# Millet for 15-150 students

If you're reading this, you might be an enterprising [15-150][] student attempting to get Millet working with course handouts.

I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, it's possible that you may need to tweak your code a bit for Millet to understand it.

Note that, at time of writing, Millet is **not officially supported** by the 15-150 staff. It's inadvisable to ask TAs how to set up or debug Millet, since they might not even know what it is.

## Support for `$` paths

Millet requires some help to understand certain SML/NJ CM features used by 15-150 handout files.

Notably, CM files distributed by 15-150 often reference a custom `$` path, `$ONEFIFTY-LIB`. This custom path is defined via the use of a path config file, to which the environment variable `CM_LOCAL_PATHCONFIG` is configured to point.

This is problematic for Millet, because Millet doesn't know about the `CM_LOCAL_PATHCONFIG` environment variable.

To fix, we must tell Millet about custom path variables via another means, `millet.toml`.

### Example

Consider this partial directory structure:

```
handout/
  code/
    ...
  lib/
    ...
    pathconfig
```

The root directory is called `handout`.

We have our code that we edit in `code`, and library files in `lib`. We also have the custom path config file `lib/pathconfig`, which has the contents

```
ONEFIFTY-LIB .
```

which means `ONEFIFTY-LIB` resolves to the current directory (`.`) of the `pathconfig` file, aka `handout/lib`.

To tell Millet about this path, we make `handout/millet.toml` with these contents:

```toml
version = 1
[workspace.path-vars]
ONEFIFTY-LIB = { path = "lib" }
```

This tells Millet that the path variable `ONEFIFTY-LIB` should be substituted for the value of the path to `lib`.

## Source files must be in order

Millet requires the files listed in CM files to be in order.

It is a feature of CM that source files within a CM file may be listed out of order. A conforming implementation of CM, such as the one that ships with SML/NJ, will determine the correct order in which to process these source files.

Millet is not a conforming implementation, and it uses the order of SML files listed in CM as the order in which it actually analyzes the files.

### Example

In the following example, Millet will emit an "undefined" error for the reference to the structure `Foo` in `Bar.sml`, but SML/NJ will accept the code without errors.

This is because Millet will attempt to analyze `Bar.sml` before `Foo.sml`, because `Bar.sml` comes before `Foo.sml` in the `sources.cm` file.

#### `sources.cm`

```sml-nj-cm
Group is
  Bar.sml
  Foo.sml
```

#### `Foo.sml`

```sml
structure Foo = struct
  val x = 123
end
```

#### `Bar.sml`

```sml
val _ = Foo.x
```

To have the code be accepted by both SML/NJ and Millet, change the order of the files listed in `sources.cm` to list first `Foo.sml`, then `Bar.sml`.

```diff
--- a/sources.cm
+++ b/sources.cm
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 Group is
-  Bar.sml
   Foo.sml
+  Bar.sml
```

## Some SML/NJ-isms are not accepted

SML/NJ deviates from the formal [Definition of Standard ML][sml-def] in a few places. Millet accepts and analyzes programs with some of these deviations, but not others.

For instance:

- The Definition forbids `signature` and `functor` declarations to appear within both `local` declarations and `struct ... end` structure-level expressions.
- Millet allows only the former.
- SML/NJ allows both.

To fix, you may have to rewrite some SML handout code.

For instance, here's an example of rewriting to avoid using a `functor` within a `functor`.

```diff
--- a/code/foo/MkFoo.sml
+++ b/code/foo/MkFoo.sml
@@ -1,17 +1,9 @@

+  structure Depth10 = struct structure Options = Options val search_depth = 10 end

   structure Bar3 = MkBar (Depth3)
   structure Bar5 = MkBar (Depth5)
```

## Last resort: turn off the language server

If the errors are too hard to fix, you can turn off the language server for specific directories.

In VS Code, open "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings", search for `millet.server.enabled`, and set it to `false`.

The language server will continue to be enabled by default if you open a different folder. This is useful if you want to disable Millet for only one particularly tricky handout.

This doesn't disable SML syntax highlighting, snippets, etc.
