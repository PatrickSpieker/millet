# Millet

A set of tools for Standard ML.

Right now, the set has only one element: a [language server][lang-server], with
a corresponding [Visual Studio Code][vscode] language client extension.

This project is alpha-quality software. It is nearing MVP status, but is not yet
there. There are many important things not yet implemented. See `doc/todo.md`.

Note that this readme is intended for users rather than contributors. To learn
how to contribute, see `doc/readme.md`.

## Naming

"Millet" has M and L in it, in that order. So does "Standard ML".

Also, birds eat millet, and a bird named Polly Morphism is the mascot for
[15-150][one-fifty], Carnegie Mellon's introductory functional programming
course taught in Standard ML.
