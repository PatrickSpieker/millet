# Standard Basis

The SML files here were mostly generated via [sml-basis][] from the public SML basis documentation [website][].

The website demands that a copyright notice accompany distributions of the documentation. It is reproduced below, though I am not sure if the files I've generated constitute a "copy" or "distribution", since I (azdavis) transformed the HTML into SML via my own original code.
