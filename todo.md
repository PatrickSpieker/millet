listed in approximate order they should be addressed in

- modernize
  - integrate new lexer
  - integrate new parser (rowan)
  - re-copy from event parse?
  - integrate lowering + HIR
  - freshen up statics
  - allow returning many errors from each 'pass'
  - remove old code
  - change constant -> literal
- improve statics for type variables
  - implicit scoping
  - performing closure operations
  - checking whether expressions are expansive (oh no!)
  - type variables in signatures
- fix statics for equality types
  - some TODOs are in the code
- fix statics for functors

  - signature expressions
  - programs
- support many files
  - via CM? (guh)
  - via `millet.json` in the workspace root which would list the ordered files in this project
- implement statics for unused constructs (abstype, while, `#` selectors)?
- publish extension
  - get azure account or whatever
- get better error messages
  - improve locs for signature matching
  - prefer 'expected int list, found bool list' instead of 'expected int, found bool' and similar?
  - show fully qualified names in type errors
  - better overload errors: maybe we should choose what that overloaded type should be sooner
  - better parser errors?
- impl more LSP features
  - jump to definition
  - hover for type/documentation/info
- make it performant
  - only lower the parts of the syntax tree that changed?
