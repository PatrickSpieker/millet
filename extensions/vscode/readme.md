# Millet

Standard ML (SML) support for VS Code.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Language configuration (comments, brackets, etc)
- (Experimental) language server support
  - Inline errors

## Warning

The language server is very experimental and might be slow, wrong, incomplete, or unstable.

You can turn it off by setting `millet.useLanguageServer` to `false` in your vscode settings.
